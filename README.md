# RCMC
## Remote Controlled Minecraft

### What is this project?
RCMC is/will be a [ChatTriggers](https://github.com/ChatTriggers/ChatTriggers) module and discord bot that will allow you to control a Minecraft game remotely. This lets a real Minecraft client connect to a server that can be controlled remotely, so if a server bans bots and programs like Mineflayer, this wont be detected as a bot.
